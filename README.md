1.3 is a stable beta version of this program. There are known bugs please see bugs.txt for details  
If you use this program it's recommended you save after each stage (before changing stages in the editor) and create a separate patch/rom for each stage so that you don't lose progress when editing

# v1.3b:  
-Fixed heart tank bug where it would cause other heart tanks to disappear when you collected one

# v1.3:
-Graphics for items (subtanks, heart tanks, weapon tank, etc.) now display in editor for MMX3 like the other games.  
-Editor and Emulator menu items are no longer grayed out after opening a file  
-Got the subtank graphic to display properly (before it was missing bottom half)  
-Got the ride armor module graphic to display properly for MMX3 (there's 3 graphics on specific stages that unlock specific ride armor)  
-When pressing arrow keys in dialog boxes it now changes value accordingly. (before it did the inverse, if you pressed up the value would go down and pressing down vice versa)  

# v1.2:
-Fixed layout in Overdrive Ostrich  
-Disabled CompressTiles() for Blizzard Buffalo and Bubble Crab  
-Added End Emulation to menu items  
-Save As now changes filename in the title bar after saving.

-Graphic for life energy now uses correct palette. Item graphics (life energy, heart tank, sub tank, weapon energy, and extra life) now display for MMX1&MMX2.  
-In event editor window it displays info text for items, checkpoints, capsules, and enemy sprites for mmx1-x3
