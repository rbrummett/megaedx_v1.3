**other than known issues in readme.txt**
* 
* Megaman X1 crashes during rom expansion (sometimes)
* A program like SnesStuff is better for rom expansion
* Rockman & Forte crashes during rom expansion
* Save States cause crash
* Load States also cause crash 
* A few graphics don't load such as RT-55J, Utuboros, and Bit/Byte don't load correctly 
* 
* something about mmx3 doppler stage 2 where if you edit the level it's only 
* visible if you defeat vile??
* i.e. changes won't show if boss is vile instead of Volt Kureigil (vile breaks
* the glass and damages stage if still alive)
* editor loads graphics on doppler stage 2 from Vile Defeated. Does not load 
* graphics for Vile Alive (ie broken glass, etc.)
* [defeating Vile before Doppler Stage 2 is optional]
* 
* Similar issues with Flame Mammoth stage in MMX1- it shows fire graphics not ice,
* but in the next scene when you scroll you can see the ice graphics. A few other
* levels have this trigger event. Editor typically only loads the default version of a level,
* but tiles are visible (and editable??)
* 
* also editing one level causes another level's stage to discard all changes and
* reset to default?
* You have to save all changes to each stage before switching stages using Page Up
* or Page Down because changes are stored in RAM (temporary memory)
* [I'm thinking of prompting an alert if the program notices changes to the game but
* unsaved before switching stages]

//Capcom

From RHDN, @crisz reyes
In MMX-Zero Text Fix, double-boss in some areas (storm eagle stage, sigma stage) [may be hard-coded from hack. not a bug]
Sting Chameleon causes minor graphical issues
subtanks only fill half the bar (may be related to v1.0 and v1.1)

//Previous fixes
1. Overdrive Ostrich was loading the level and saving incorrectly. I created a work-around that allows 1 save (but reverts back to bad layout after next save). Best work-around is rom expansion.
2. Heart tank was causing graphical issues. I didn't know the correct assembly number for this graphic so used a dummy value that worked (in the subid), but forgot to go back and delete it after finding correct value.
